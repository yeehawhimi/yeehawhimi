- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yeehawhimi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Helluva boss, Hazbin hotel, Alien stage, Genshin, warframe
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... I tend to lose track of messages or get distracted easily on ponytown! You are always welcome to shisper me if you need my attention and I will reply when I see it. I am always open to cuddles and hugs unless I am with friends
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... she, they, he
- âš¡ about me: ... I am 26 years old, so I would prefer minors not interact with me. I tend to afk a lot on ponytown, but do not mind company. I occasonally will check the tab. sometimes while having a conversation I'll get sidetracked and go quiet, so if I go quiet it's not that I don't want to talk to you. I am simply distracted,
